# terrain-tiles
an open source project hoping to make a diy option for tiling modular war gaming terrain.

## The Terminology I use in this documentation.
I will refer to the bigger, 12"x12" base squares with the term "boards". The gridded squares that are atop them will be referred to as "tiles".

## The Idea
I thought the Zone Mortalis: Floor Tile Set  was a neat concept and wanted to come up with an alternative. This design improves upon those (in my opinion) by presenting an open source, repeatable, DIY framework that doesnt require glueing anything down. I wanted a 12"x12" board with a 6x6 grid to mimic the name brand option, and I wanted to figure out all the math for you. A system like this shines for a game like Necromunda.

## Recomended Materials
- You will need 1/8" thick sheet material, I would recommend PVC Sheet if you can get your hands on it, but something like hardboard would work just as well and is available at the big box hardware stores. I even use cardboard for the prototype, seen in the [example](https://github.com/hobbysiege/terrain-tiles/blob/main/README.md#examples). Another option might be corrugated plastic sheeting (Coroplast).
- Glue! This will depend entirely on your sheet materials. Traditianal xyanoacrylate (super glue) should work fine for the plastics, wood glue might be best for hardboard. Hell, hot glue might be a reasonable option for some of these. I don't know different until you tell me.
- Thats it really, you will probably want to decorate these someway with paints. In the [example](https://github.com/hobbysiege/terrain-tiles/blob/main/README.md#examples) I just used permant marker on the cardboard. I think it gives it a charming cell-shaded like appearance.

## Recommended Tools
- Traditional Flexible Tile Spacers, both 1/8" and 1/16". These will help keep your grid consistent, 1/8" for between tiles and 1/6" for the edge of each board. These are also availabe at the big box hardware stores.
- Something to cut your sheet materials with. This will also depend on your sheet materials. Hardboard and PVC both might require a table saw, but cardboard or corrugated sheeting would cut with a hobby or razor knife.
- A ruler, tape measure, square, or anything else you might need to keep your material as square as possible while cutting it.
For the cardboard prototype I used a cutting mat, hobby knife, metal ruler, hot glue, and a permanent marker.

## Reference Material
Check out the folder in this repository for a 2D SVG, and a 3D Model, if you print this, let me know! Feel free to add some texture to the tiles and share that back here.

## How To
1. You will first need to cut your sheet material down into a number of 12"x12" boards. These will be your base. If you're not sure how many, maybe start with 9 of them to make a good 3'x3' game board.
2. Next, your sheet material will need to be cut into `1 7/8"` squares. You will need 36 of these per board, or, unfortunately, 324 for the 3'x3' board mentioned above. If this seems overwhelming, start with just a couple boards, or reduce the number of tiles to a 3x3 grid and cut your squares to `3 7/8"`. The space between each tile will remain the same. The main down side to using a bigger grid with less tiles is control you have over the size of the terrain pieces you will put on the tiles.
  - If you are cutting these by hand, the multiples of `1 7/8"` are `1 7/8"`, `3 3/4"`, `5 5/8"`, `7 1/2"`, `9 3/8"`, and `11 1/4"`. I stopped there because I am using a 12" ruler but you get the idea.
4. Use the tile spacers to layout your grid and glue it down. The 1/16" spacers are for the outside edges of the board, this allows you to butt two boards together and continue the 1/8" spacing of the rest of the grid. This leaves the 1/8" spacers for the space between the tiles atop each board.


## Now What?
With your boards made, go ahead and make some buildings, containers, walkways, and what-have-you! Put your boards next to each other, hook them together with your terrain pieces, paint it all, and game!
