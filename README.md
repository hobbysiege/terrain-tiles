# terrain-tiles
an open source project hoping to make a diy option for tiling modular war gaming terrain.

## What it means

## Recomended Materials
- You will need 1/8" thick sheet material, I would recommend PVC Board if you can get your hands on it, but something like hardboard would work just as well and is available at the big box hardware stores. I even use cardboard for the prototype, seen in the example.

## Recommended Tools
- Traditional Flexible Tile Spacers, both 1/8" and 1/16". These will help keep your grid consistent, 1/8" for between tiles and 1/6" for the edge of each board. These are also availabe at the big box hardware stores.

## Examples
