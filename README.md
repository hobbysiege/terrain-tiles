# terrain-tiles
an open source project hoping to make a diy option for tiling modular war gaming terrain.

## What it means

## Recomended Materials
- You will need 1/8" thick sheet material, I would recommend PVC Board if you can get your hands on it, but something like hardboard would work just as well and is available at the big box hardware stores. I even use cardboard for the prototype, seen in the example. Another option might be corrugated plastic sheeting (Coroplast).
- Glue! This will depend entirely on your sheet materials. Traditianal xyanoacrylate (super glue) should work fine for the plastics, wood glue might be best for hardboard. Hell, hot glue might be a reasonable option for some of these. I don't know different until you tell me.
- Thats it really, you will probably want to decorate these someway with paints. In the example I just used permant marker on the cardboard. I think it gives it a charming cell-shaded like appearance.

## Recommended Tools
- Traditional Flexible Tile Spacers, both 1/8" and 1/16". These will help keep your grid consistent, 1/8" for between tiles and 1/6" for the edge of each board. These are also availabe at the big box hardware stores.
- Something to cut your sheet materials with. This will also depend on your sheet materials. Hardboard and PVC both might require a table saw, but cardboard or corrugated sheeting would cut with a hobby or razor knife.
